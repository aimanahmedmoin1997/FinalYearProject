This chapter provides detailed specifications of the system under development.

\section{Functional Requirements}

This section describes each function/feature provided by our system. These functions are logically grouped into modules based on their purpose/users/mode of operations etc (as per our system). A functional hierarchy may look like:
\begin{outline}
  \1 Module 1:
  \2 Function 1:
  \2 Function 2:
  \3 Sub Function 1
  \3 Sub Function 2
  \1 Module 2:
  \2 Function 1:
  \2 Function 2:
  \1 .........
\end{outline}

% --- The above is to be modified as per your project, e.g. a flat list if your system has limited functional requirements.

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

This sections mentions the specific non-functional requirements of our system. These generally address performance, scalability, safety, availability, deployment etc.

\section{External Interfaces}

\subsection{User Interfaces}
This section includes our mockup screens and briefly explains them.

\subsection{Application Program Interface (API)}
This section describes the library or API interface to our system.

\subsection{Hardware/Communication Interfaces}
This section describes our project's specific hardware/network interfaces.

\section{Use Cases}
This section presents detailed use cases of our system.

\section{Datasets}
This section describes the specific dataset(s) used to build our system. An appropriate snapshot of the dataset(s) is also included. Futher details, when needed, are presented in the appendix.

\section{System Diagram}
This diagram gives a high-level view of the different components of our system and the interactions between them. Each component and the particular tools/technologies/libraries used to build it are described.
