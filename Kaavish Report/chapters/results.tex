Sadly this part of the report will be left blank. Of all the hindrances that came with the current pandemic, one that left us with a great loss, is our experimentation and results part of the project.\\
Our previous research on the need of this platform confirmed that our project will be able to self-sustain, if not progress much. But this experimentation could not be carried out due to lockdown.\\ 
Family situations and technical and moral challenges at home hindered our learning curve and we could not fully complete and implement the project on time as promised.
