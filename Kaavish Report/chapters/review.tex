This chapter presents the current state of the art in the domain and talks about other similar work that has been done in this area. It also establishes the novelty of our work by highlighting the differences between the existing work and our work.

We will keep updating this chapter (especially if our project is research-intensive) as our research proceeds and we come across more work related to our problem.

Of course, we take inspiration from \cite{einstein} but wish the work was typeset in \LaTeX \cite{knuthwebsite}, e.g. by taking help from \cite{latexcompanion}.
